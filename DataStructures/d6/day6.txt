What is the need of binary trees?

Linked list is a linear DS and only allows linear search.
Binary search is a performance optimization over linear search.
Therefore, binary search trees are better way to store data if,
searching data efficiently is a high priority.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, 
except possibly the last, is completely filled, 
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. 
It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes at the last level h. 
A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented as an array.

A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which 
all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level 
(the level of a node defined as the number of edges or links from the root node to a node). 
A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree.
A perfect tree is therefore always complete but a complete tree is not always perfect.

AVL and Red Black trees are not covered in this module.

Notes on compilation process:

C compiler is said to be a 2 phase compiler.
----------------------------------------------

program --> (ASCII) --> first.c
 |
 |---> Pre-Processing (preprocessing related errors)
 |
Source code --> first.i  (aka intermediary code after preprocessor directives are processed)
 |
 | --> Compilation (Phase I) --> .s file --> declarations (declaration related errors)
 |
Object Code --> first.o/first.obj
 |
 | --> Linking (Phase II) --> definition (definition related errors)
 |
 V
Executable --> (Binary) --> a.out 

three temp files are deleted and only a.out file is kept as its the executable.

in order to save temp files like .i, .s, .o
use flag -save-temps
like:
gcc -save-temps filename.c

for only .i => -e
for only .s => -S
for only .o => -o
